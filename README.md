# SOCKET MULTITHREADING

## Idea
Communication between clients, always that exists a new connections or instance, the server add the instance connection an a threading list. If the connections is down the instance is removed of thread list.

The client send a message into server and the server distribute for all devices connected on the thread list.

The broadcast will distribute the message for devices of thread list minus the device that sending the message

### Starting the `server` and `client` example
After start, If server is already running, return a message

```python

python3 server/server.py

> listen

# Msg
# <<Server>> The server is already running

```

For client after connect input the client name

```python 

python3 client/client.py 

Device name> Ant贸nio

Ant贸nio> connected

On this section you can write your message for send to other devices

```
Preview of interaction per messages

```python

Device name> Ant贸nio

Ant贸nio> connected

Pedro> Hi, you are fine?
Pedro> news

```
Thread of server

```python
def run(self) -> Optional[str]:
    """run and connect"""

    # AF_INET: for use ipv4, SOCK_STREAM: for working with TCP
    server = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)

    try:
        server.bind(('localhost', 7777))

        # limit 10 connections
        server.listen(10)

    except:
        return f"<<Server>> The server is already running"

    while True:
        client, addr = server.accept()
        self.__clients.append(client)

        msg_thread = Thread(target=self.__msg_treatment, args=[client])
        msg_thread.start()

```
